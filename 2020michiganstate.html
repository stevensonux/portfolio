<p>At a Glance...</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Project: Internal file organization for both departments</li>
    	<li>Goals: Transition from an entirely paper-based database to a structured digital information architecture</li>
    	<li>Target Audience: Faculty and Staff of both departments</li>
    	<li>The Challenge: Finding a structure for the information that not only served its function, but facilitated the workplace experience</li>
		<li>Role: Supervised lead.</li>
	</ul>
                    <p><h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p class="mb-30">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I first arrived on the job, these two departments still functioned almost entirely on paper and a physical filing system, which inhibited ease of locating important and sensitive documents in the workplace. After a month or so, I joined the pitch toward the idea to move the department's files into their internal system's file service. The initial file service lacked much in terms of structure, and needed a complete overhaul. With the needs of my employers, current, and future faculty members in mind, I would have to construct an internal structure for the information that was not only functional, but easy to understand for any faculty member, and ensured ease of access toward all of the information within. My supervisor set me on the job, and together we revised and implemented a functional, simplistic, and easy structure for locating department files and documentation. </p>
                    <blockquote><h4>THE PROCESS:</h4>
                     Interviews, Wireflows </blockquote>
                    
					<p><h4>User Research: Interviews</h4>
					<p class="mb-30">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To better gain an understanding of who these people were and what they needed out of this system, I conducted user interviews with the head of each department, as well as department secretaries, student mentors, and student advisors.
					<br>
					<br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Asking these questions in a face-to-face interview also gave me the opportunity to ask for elaboration on what might have been short responses or opinions; of which I got many, considering most of the people I interviewed were unsure of what they wanted in a functional system. In the end, this was the method of research I found to be one of the most invaluable, because it opened new doors for thought and consideration that would need to be taken into mind when designing for them.</p></p>
				<p><h4>Wireflows</h4>
					<p class="mb-30">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a very visual designer and thinker, I usually start the design process with low fidelity wireflows to best understand the workflow I will be leading my users through. This way, I can ensure that there are no details overlooked during the next steps of implementation.

						</p></p>
					<p><h4>The Rest</h4>
					<p class="mb-30">Everything in between was mostly, a lot of staying organized, and a LOT of scanning. Turns out, it's hard work turning two graduate departments and their decade's worth of paperwork into a digital system. 
						<br>
						When you're knee deep in paper, and your harddrive is cluttered with "SCAN - 00/00/00 00:00 (5)" and all of these documents happen to rank differently in their level of classification, keeping to a strong design idea will save you. Really, staying organized and sticking to the wireflow was what made the project a success in the end.
					</p></p>
			  
			  		<p><h4>Reflection</h4>
					<p class="mb-30">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A lot in this projects went well, and the biggest challenge I had was getting in the heads of several types of people at once. I felt the interviews were both necessary and unnecessary- they were the greatest influence for my structure, but next time for a card sort may be better suited to the topic and timeframe.
