	  <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I first began this job as an intern newly introduced into the world of User Experience Design, and to date it had been one of my biggest and most fulfilling challenges that not only gave real world job experience, but honed my skills in so many areas of product and UX design</p>
	
<p class="intro">    The ultimate goal was to create a pleasant, easy to use, and effective intranet service that met the wants, needs, and aesthetics of 5 different company branches, while simultaneously encouraging and facilitating communication between these branches and their employees. I was admittedly intimidated, considering this was my first internship, but nonetheless I knew what I had to do, and I laid out my plan for design and implementation as follows:</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the beginning, I was paired with the IT department's lead and the company web designer as one of the primary guides and leads for the project. The intranet service would be hosted through UK platform "Claromentis," which we would be trained on for a total of 7 zoom-oriented training sessions with Claromentis company support.

	 	<h2>Interviews</h2>
		<p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a project of this size, there were a lot of users' needs we needed to take into consideration in order to create the perfect service. I ended up setting interviews with representatives from each branch, ranging from department or branch leads to branch agents and employees with strong ideas for the finished product.
		<br>
		Before the interviews started, I compiled a list of some of the most important questions I had for the interviewees. I started off asking them to walk me through a day in their shoes. Who did they need to talk to? When would they need to talk to them? What tasks were tedious due to poor communication? What would a perfect work day look like?
		<br>
		After asking some of these lighter questions, I pressed the interviews further into the technical side. Did the company already have an intranet service? What was it like? Were there things they liked about it, or didn't like? If there wasn't an intranet service, do they have needs they think could be met by one? What was one thing they liked about their current workflow that they'd like to see carried over? What about something they disliked, and would like to live without? 
			<br>
		Using these questions and others, I conducted 20 minute interviews with over 20 individuals from different branches within the company. I was able to then sort and analyze the results of each and create a general idea of what the recurring themes of each branch's needs consisted of.

	 	<h2>User Personas</h2>
		<p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After interviewing people from all throughout the company, I took the information I'd gathered about each of the users and generated user personas to better establish the type of users that would be interacting with the service.

This way, I can ensure that there are no details overlooked during the next steps of implementation. </p>

    <h2>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h2>
		<p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though the project did not require an extensive amount, there were a few times within the intranet building process that additional elements and design choices needed to be implemented via code work. These were typically minor size or display adjustments, though they still required some intimate knowledge of the functions of all three languages.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the beginning phases, many of our initial models turned out successful. Over time, and the more "used to" the project that users became, we received more comments and suggestions to better adapt the layout of information to their needs.
