	  <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I first began this job as an intern newly introduced into the world of User Experience Design, and to date it had been one of my biggest and most fulfilling challenges that not only gave real world job experience, but honed my skills in so many areas of product and UX design</p>
	
<p class="intro">    The ultimate goal was to create a pleasant, easy to use, and effective intranet service that met the wants, needs, and aesthetics of 5 different company branches, while simultaneously encouraging and facilitating communication between these branches and their employees. I was admittedly intimidated, considering this was my first internship, but nonetheless I knew what I had to do, and I laid out my plan for design and implementation as follows:</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the beginning, I was paired with the IT department's lead and the company web designer as one of the primary guides and leads for the project. The intranet service would be hosted through UK platform "Claromentis," which we would be trained on for a total of 7 zoom-oriented training sessions with Claromentis company support. 
	<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I chose this research method in the beginning because of its personability; people are able to better sing their praises or air their grievances with the existing benefits or problems during conversation. Additionally, getting to talk with faculty members one on one gave me a better image of who they were as people; what demographics or ability levels would they be falling under? Were there people who preferred the paper system, and why?
	<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Asking these questions in a face-to-face interview also gave me the opportunity to ask for elaboration on what might have been short responses or opinions; of which I got many, considering most of the people I interviewed were unsure of what they wanted in a functional system. In the end, this was the method of research I found to be one of the most invaluable, because it opened new doors for thought and consideration that would need to be taken into mind when designing for them.

	 	<h2>Wireflows</h2>
		<p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a very visual designer and thinker, I usually start the design process with low fidelity wireflows to best understand the workflow I will be leading my users through. This way, I can ensure that there are no details overlooked during the next steps of implementation. </p>

    <h2>Testing and Revision</h2>
		<p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because of the nature of the project, implementation of the processes were instant; we had users testing throughout the entire process and providing a constant feed of response to reference in the revision processes.
	<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the beginning phases, many of our initial models turned out successful. Over time, and the more "used to" the project that users became, we received more comments and suggestions to better adapt the layout of information to their needs.
