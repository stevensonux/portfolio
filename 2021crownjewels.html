    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
	  <h4>At a Glance...</h4>
    <ul>
		<li>Project: create a brand and a website for a developing performance company</li>
    	<li>Goals: Compose an effective brand that resonates with visitors, an effective design that is easy to remember and navigate, and develop a website that is both accessible and aesthetically pleasing.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    	<li>Target Audience: Volunteering "Gigs", Private Birthday Parties&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    	<li>The Challenge: Use the limiations of Google Sites to create a webpage that is easily modifiable for the company.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
		<li>Role: Lead, sole developer and designer.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; This was a project I took particular interest in, considering this is a company I personally manage in my spare time. (Yes, I do UX by day and children's parties and volunteering on the side. It's a passion!) I wanted to make it easier for volunteer oppportunities or companies to come into contact with me, while also providing detailed pricing and a method of contact for acting gigs and party clients.</p>
      <p>The biggest challenge? Make the webpage editable by my other partners, who don't have web experience and don't much care to learn. The settled proposal was on Google Sites, and while I'd figured this was going to be a little difficult, I enjoyed the challenge to use a platform that has more than my typical amount of limitations. </p>

    <h2>User Personas&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a newer student employee, my employer was better understanding of the needs of my coworkers and faculty members than I was. To better gain an understanding of who these people were and what they needed out of this system, I conducted user interviews with the head of each department, as well as department secretaries, student mentors, and student advisors.
	<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I chose this research method in the beginning because of its personability; people are able to better sing their praises or air their grievances with the existing benefits or problems during conversation. Additionally, getting to talk with faculty members one on one gave me a better image of who they were as people; what demographics or ability levels would they be falling under? Were there people who preferred the paper system, and why?
	<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Asking these questions in a face-to-face interview also gave me the opportunity to ask for elaboration on what might have been short responses or opinions; of which I got many, considering most of the people I interviewed were unsure of what they wanted in a functional system. In the end, this was the method of research I found to be one of the most invaluable, because it opened new doors for thought and consideration that would need to be taken into mind when designing for them.

	 	<h2>Wireflows</h2>
		<p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a very visual designer and thinker, I usually start the design process with low fidelity wireflows to best understand the workflow I will be leading my users through. This way, I can ensure that there are no details overlooked during the next steps of implementation. </p>

    <h2>Testing and Revision</h2>
		<p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because of the nature of the project, implementation of the processes were instant; we had users testing throughout the entire process and providing a constant feed of response to reference in the revision processes.
	<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the beginning phases, many of our initial models turned out successful. Over time, and the more "used to" the project that users became, we received more comments and suggestions to better adapt the layout of information to their needs.
