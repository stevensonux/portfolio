   		 <ul>
			<li>Project: Intranet service development across multiple branches&nbsp;</li>
    		<li>Goals: Facilitate managing employees and communication between each of the 5 branches within the Real Estate One company</li>
    		<li>Target Audience: Managers and Employees</li>
    		<li>The Challenge: Building a system that accomplished specific tasks for each branch, while also encouraging and facilitating company interaction between branches through shared intranet features&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
			<li>Role: Lead, under supervision.</li>
	 	 </ul>
                    <p><h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p class="mb-30">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I first began this job as an intern newly introduced into the world of User Experience Design, and to date it had been one of my biggest and most fulfilling challenges that not only gave real world job experience, but honed my skills in so many areas of product and UX design.</p></p>
                    <p class="mb-30">The ultimate goal was to create a pleasant, easy to use, and effective intranet service that met the wants, needs, and aesthetics of 5 different company branches, while simultaneously encouraging and facilitating communication between these branches and their employees. I laid out my plan for design and implementation as follows:</p>
                    <blockquote><h4>THE PROCESS:</h4> Project Management, User Research, HTML, CSS, JS, Claromentis (Collaborative tool of choice)</blockquote>
                    <p class="mb-30"> In the beginning, I was paired with the IT department's lead and the company web designer as one of the primary guides and leads for the project. The intranet service would be hosted through UK platform "Claromentis," which we would be trained on for a total of 7 zoom-oriented training sessions with Claromentis company support.</p>
					<p><h4>Interviewing Users</h4>
					<p class="mb-30">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With a project of this size, there were a lot of users' needs we needed to take into consideration in order to create the perfect service. I ended up setting interviews with representatives from each branch, ranging from department or branch leads to branch agents and employees with strong ideas for the finished product.<br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before the interviews started, I compiled a list of some of the most important questions I had for the interviewees. I started off asking them to walk me through a day in their shoes. Who did they need to talk to? When would they need to talk to them? What tasks were tedious due to poor communication? What would a perfect work day look like?
					<br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After asking some of these lighter questions, I pressed the interviews further into the technical side. Did the company already have an intranet service? What was it like? Were there things they liked about it, or didn't like? If there wasn't an intranet service, do they have needs they think could be met by one? What was one thing they liked about their current workflow that they'd like to see carried over? What about something they disliked, and would like to live without? 
					<br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Using these questions and others, I conducted 20 minute interviews with over 20 individuals from different branches within the company. I was able to then sort and analyze the results of each and create a general idea of what the recurring themes of each branch's needs consisted of.  </p></p>
				  <p><h4>User Personas</h4>
					<p class="mb-30">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After interviewing people from all throughout the company, I took the information I'd gathered about each of the users and generated user personas to better establish the type of users that would be interacting with the service.</p></p>
				<p><h4>Wireflows and Prototyping</h4>
					<p class="mb-30">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a very visual designer and thinker, I usually start the design process with low fidelity wireflows to best understand the workflow I will be leading my users through. This way, I can ensure that there are no details overlooked during the next steps of implementation.
					<br>
					From there, we got to work with creating our first prototypes. Claromentis was a collaborative tool we learned specifically for this project, and because of its nature as a collaborative tool we went through several versions of loose prototypes before finally settling on one for each department.
