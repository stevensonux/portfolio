                    <p><h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p class="mb-30">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I worked alongside Jodi Dines, Real Estate One CIO, and a team of developers on a project that spanned a total of 6 months from concept to full implementation. The ultimate goal was to create a pleasant, easy to use, and effective intranet service that met the wants, needs, and aesthetics of 5 different company branches, while simultaneously encouraging and facilitating communication between these branches and their employees. I laid out my plan for design and implementation as follows:</p>
                    <blockquote><h4>THE PROCESS:</h4> Learning Claromentis, User Research, Prototyping & Refinement, Finalization & Implementation, and Reflection. </blockquote>
                    <p class="mb-30"> In the beginning, we were briefed on the collaborative tool we would be using for the The intranet service would be hosted through UK platform "Claromentis," which we would be trained on for a total of 7 zoom-oriented training sessions with Claromentis company support. After the projects completion, it would be our job to then teach the other designated administrators how to operate the pages from a lower level of clearance.</p>
					<p><h4>User Research: Interviews</h4>
					<p class="mb-30">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With a project of this size, there were a lot of users' needs we needed to take into consideration in order to create the perfect service. I ended up setting interviews with representatives from each branch, ranging from department or branch leads to branch agents and employees with strong ideas for the finished product.<br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before the interviews started, I compiled a list of some of the most important questions I had for the interviewees. I started off asking them to walk me through a day in their shoes. Who did they need to talk to? When would they need to talk to them? What tasks were tedious due to poor communication? What would a perfect work day look like?
					<br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After asking some of these lighter questions, I pressed the interviews further into the technical side. Did the company already have an intranet service? What was it like? Were there things they liked about it, or didn't like? If there wasn't an intranet service, do they have needs they think could be met by one? What was one thing they liked about their current workflow that they'd like to see carried over? What about something they disliked, and would like to live without? 
					<br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Using these questions and others, I conducted 20 minute interviews with over 20 individuals from different branches within the company. I was able to then sort and analyze the results of each and create a general idea of what the recurring themes of each branch's needs consisted of.  </p></p>
				  <p><h4>User Research: Personas</h4>
					<p class="mb-30">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After interviewing people from all throughout the company, I took the information I'd gathered about each of the users and generated user personas to better establish the type of users that would be interacting with the service.</p></p>
				<p><h4>Prototyping and Refinement</h4>
					<p class="mb-30">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a very visual designer and thinker, I usually start the design process with low fidelity wireflows to best understand the workflow I will be leading my users through. This way, I can ensure that there are no details overlooked during the next steps of implementation.
					<br>
					From there, we got to work with creating our first prototypes. Claromentis was a collaborative tool we learned specifically for this project, and because of its nature as a collaborative tool we went through several versions of loose prototypes before finally settling on one for each department.
					<br> With each prototype came revisions that needed to be made. The original plan for a hero banner was removed for the sake of conserving space and making workflow faster. Weather applications and other functions that were "cool" but ultimately deemed "clutter" were removed and replaced with communicative assets.
					<br> Each version of a prototype was followed with a user test group, with which I would meet and watch as they made their way through the pages, noting any discrepancies, errors, or items that could be better placed. 
						</p></p>
					<p><h4>Finalization & Implementation</h4>
					<p class="mb-30">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because I was returning to school for the start of the Fall Semester during this stage of project, I mostly watched the final implementation from afar while colleagues updated me on changes or issues with the project. After inputting employee databases to the user intranet system and generating user accounts that operated with SSO systems, the intranet service became fully implemented.</p></p>
