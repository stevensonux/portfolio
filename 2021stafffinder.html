    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
	  <h4>At a Glance...</h4>
    <ul>
		<li>Project: Design an effective, aesthetic, and memorable brand for the company.</li>

    	<li>Target Audience: Potential clients, prospective hires of the company</li>
		<li>Role: Volunteer designer</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This job came to me from a close friend in need of redesign options for her company, Staff Finders Inc., a manufacturing recruitment agency out of mid michigan. She emphasized particularly that the previous branding had gone out of date and required a more up-to-date look to draw in potential clients and recruits. After a meeting and a couple cups of coffee, we discussed what her expectations out of a perfect redesign might look like to her; something modern and sleek that reflected the company values, as well as a refined and professional design that gave the company strong visual credibility. All things I could do! </p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After speaking with my friend, the client, about her company, its values, history, and what she wanted out of the branding, I came to narrow out a few key words throughout our conversation. These key words would define the rest of the design process, and be adjectives to remember throughout design decisions:<ul>
		<li>Modern</li>
		<li>Sleek</li>
		<li>Professional</li>
		<li>Crisp</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
<p>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From these concepts, I could begin gathering ideas and inspiration from outside sources. I got to work, figuring out a design that would better define the company's intent while still maintain some of their established branding.
 </p>
	<br>
<p>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; First, I analyzed the initial design: An idea on movement, the idea of exchange with the directions of the arrows, and a slanted font to further emphasize that movement. This idea of movement in design is a great one for a staffing agency, though I was worried that the initial design conveyed almost *too* much of it, resulting in ideas of being rushed or hurried. I decided to take the idea and dial it back while maintaining the integrity of the original concept. </p>

	 	<h2>Mood Boarding</h2>
		<p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a task like this one, I felt a mood board to establish a closer idea of the overall revised concept. I took particular interest and inspiration in incorporating a personal favorite concept of biomimicry and the influence of nature; what is more hard working, fast travelling, and strong in connection than the honeybee? The honeycomb shapes allow the use of rigid lines in a notable pattern that ties with the concept. </p>

    <h2>Final Branding Examples</h2>
		<p class="intro">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With the finalized product for the logo, I moved on toward the concept of branding, creating a few examples of what their image could look like for the final presentation to the client. After this, I presented the client with the finished result; and she loved it!</p>
